This JavaScript application integrates a blockchain-powered "Quote of the Day" service into a web page. The app utilizes the Ethereum network, Web3.js library, and a smart contract to enable users to retrieve and set daily quotes.

**Intended Audience:**
1. **Developers:** Developers who want to learn how to interact with Ethereum smart contracts and create decentralized applications using Web3.js.
2. **Blockchain Enthusiasts:** Individuals interested in exploring real-world applications of blockchain technology.
3. **Web Designers:** Web designers who wish to enhance their websites with blockchain-based services.
4. **Blockchain Developers:** Developers seeking to create or enhance similar blockchain-backed services.

**Key Features:**
- **Blockchain Integration:** The app interacts with the Ethereum blockchain via the Web3.js library, allowing users to read and write data securely on the blockchain.
- **Read and Set Quotes:** Users can fetch the current "Quote of the Day" from the smart contract, or set a new quote by submitting it to the contract.
- **Ethereum Wallet Connectivity:** The app supports Ethereum wallet connectivity via the Ethereum browser extension, MetaMask. Users can connect their wallets and sign transactions.
- **Prompt-Based Interaction:** When users click the "Установить новую цитату" button, a prompt enables them to input a new quote for the day.

**Benefits:**
1. **Decentralization:** Utilizes blockchain technology to decentralize the storage and retrieval of daily quotes.
2. **Transparent and Tamper-Proof:** Smart contracts ensure that quotes remain transparent and tamper-proof, as they are recorded on the Ethereum blockchain.
3. **Community Engagement:** Can foster community engagement by allowing users to contribute new quotes.
4. **Educational:** Serves as a practical example for developers looking to integrate Ethereum smart contracts into their web applications.
5. **Enhanced Website:** Enhances web pages with a dynamic and blockchain-backed "Quote of the Day" feature.

This code is suitable for developers who want to learn about Ethereum smart contracts, blockchain integration, and Web3.js. It can be used as a starting point for creating decentralized applications with similar functionality, making it a valuable learning resource.
